plank counter logic

time = 0
time increments when position is assumed
position is angle between shoulder,elbow, wrist is almost 90.
time is stopped when position is not assumed.

position = angle(shoulder,elbow, wrist)
80<position<100 -> increment time
or -> time stop

        input("Press Enter to continue and ctrl+C to exit the stopwatch")
